"less -N filename" displays line numbers at the beginning of each line 
inside the "temp.txt" file. i think it is useful to see how many files 
are listed
```

## less -X filename

```
"less -X filename" is listing all the contents of the file "temp.txt" file 
but it will stay inside your terminal after quiting. i think it is useful
for refering back to in your terminal without rerunning the less command
```

## less -M filename

```
"less -M filename" shows what range of files you scrolled to, 
how many files in total, and the percentage of the file "temp.txt" file. 
i think it is useful to have some metrics to where you are. it feels
overwhelming where the file is thousands of lines long
```
